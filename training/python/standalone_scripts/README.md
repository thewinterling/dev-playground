# Standalone scripts

This folder contains standalone scripts and/or one-file-showcases of a particular problem.
Each of the files is independent from all other files here. So the use-case or 
showcase of a problem is all within that one file.
For more details of what the content is, each file has a descriptive docstring
where it is made clear what the focus of the file is.
